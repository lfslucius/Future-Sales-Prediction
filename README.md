Included loading data, exploring data, cleaning outliers and duplicates, reformatting, scaling.

### 2. Modeling ###
Applied six models like **Linear Regression, Lasso, Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, and Neural Network**.

### 3. Visualize Result ###
Use two bar charts to visualize the **R square** and **RMSE** in each model.

### 4. Test Result ###
Applied the most appropriate model into the data set for prediction and print out the expected sales in the next month.
